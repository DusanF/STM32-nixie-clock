# STM32 nixie clock
My take on nixie tube clock, using STM32G070 with internal RTC and four 74141 as drivers.
Clock uses Czechoslovak ZM1082T, but main board can by used with any nixie tubes.

## Firmware
Folder Nixie_clock contains STM32CubeIDE project. Firmware is written in C using STM32 HAL libraries. After peripherals are initialized, main loop starts with 100ms period. After checking state of buttons and reading current time from RTC, displayed time is updated if needed. Once every minute, cathode poisoning prevention routine is started, cycling through every digit for a few milliseconds, before settling at current time.

## Schematic + PCB
Folder contains KiCad project with schematic and PCB design. Schematic is also exported in pdf format.

Device is powered by 12V DC. With all 4 digits lit up, current draw is about 150mA. HV for nixies is generated by external step-up module, that can be bought cheaply on ebay, aliexpress, etc. 74141s are powered by 5V generated by 1117. MCU gets 3.3V stabilised only by zener diode from 5V rail. Oprional supercap for RTC backup is charged by MCU via integrated resistor (set in FW to 1k5).
